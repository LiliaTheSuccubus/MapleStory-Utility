# MapleUtility
 Python project used as an attempt to learn Python while making a utility designed for use in MapleStory.


I use these command line thingies from [Jeffrey](https://github.com/tanjeffreyz) to make .exe for my program. eventually i learn how to package it correctly and stuff. usually i just run from inside VS Code with debug function, but that mean u have to install VSCode if u wanna use
  <li>
    Inside main directory, open a command prompt and run:
    <pre><code>python -m pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Lastly, create a desktop shortcut by running:
    <pre><code>python setup.py</code></pre>
