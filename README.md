# MapleStory Utility Tool

This is a project I started on in an attempt to learn Python and pursue my interest in automation. It contains several (probably unfinished) features that were created to answer MapleStory's numerous design flaws, such as reptitive button presses for upgrades and cooldown timers on crafting (soon to be removed).

## Installation

Describe how to install your project.

Heck, I don't know how to release this yet, since I just run it through Visual Studio Code. I'll come back round to it and figure out a way to do that. It's prolly to do with packaging or something.

I use the below command line thingies from [Jeffrey](https://github.com/tanjeffreyz) to make .exe for my program. eventually i learn how to package it correctly and stuff. usually i just run from inside VS Code with debug function, but that mean u have to install VSCode if u wanna use
  <li>
    Inside main directory, open a command prompt and run:
    <pre><code>python -m pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Lastly, create a desktop shortcut by running:
    <pre><code>python setup.py</code></pre>

## Usage

Explain how to use your project.

The buttons have tooltips! I plan to add more things to the GUI eventually. As of right now, it just looks like a little cheat window with nice features and customizable fields. I plan to add an in-window terminal or something to display the console messages printed by the script.

## Contributing

State how others can contribute to your project, even if you're not actively looking for pull requests.

Uhhh, feel free to contribute by forking or something. It's my first time, so I dunno what standard etiquette is. If you're not a coder, feel free to send me suggestions and such, I guess! You can DM me on Discord @ justafreshstart or on any of my other socials @LiliaTheSuccubus
